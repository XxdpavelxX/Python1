Question #1:
What is a namespace? 

Answer #1:
Namespaces hold names, which refer to values (objects in object space). It is a list of names that you defined either explicitly or by importing from another module. when a module is imported then the names defined in the module are defined via that module's name space


Question #2:
How do you list the contents of a namespace? 

Answer #2:
You can do this using the dir() command.
dir(some_object)
