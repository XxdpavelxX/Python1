Question #1:
What is the difference between a syntax error and an exception? 

Answer #1:
A syntax error is an error you made in code that will crash your program. It is a mistake made in code that violates python's syntax. Syntax errors are the most common type of errors. They return the message "invalid syntax".

Exceptions are errors that are detected during execution (even if code is syntactically correct). They care caused by all kinds of mistakes.These errors return a message telling you exactly what went wrong.


Question #2:
How can you deal with exceptions in your code?

How can you re-raise an exception? 

Answer #2:
You can go back and fix what is causing the exception in your code. You can also catch these errors using try/except statements.

You can re-raise an exception by by executing a statement consisting of only the keyword raise. This will cause the same exception to be presented to the outer handlers.
