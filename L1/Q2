Question #1:
What is wrong with the following code?
print ("This is a very fun class
and I am learning about Python!")


Answer #1:
There are no triple quotation marks to start a new line.
print ("""This is a very fun class
and I am learning about Python!""").

Can also use \.
print("This is a very fun class \
and I am learning about Python!")

Or separate into separate quotes.
print("This is a very fun class "
"and I am learning about Python!")
