Question #5:
What function do you use to send output to the console? 

Answer #5:
The print command?

Comments:
Yes! Technically it's the print function, so you'd include the parentheses in the answer:

print()

In functional programming, sending a string to the console is considered
a "side effect" whereas what's returned by this "function" is None. This 
disqualifies us from calling it (the object in question) a "function" in that 
namespace (of functional programming).

Python uses the word "function" somewhat differently as to object oriented 
languages more generally.
